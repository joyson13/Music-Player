<h1> Guide to use the project</h1>

<p> Note that this project is created using plain python</p>

<h3> Instructions</h3>
1. Run `python install -r requirements.txt` (Use `python3` instead of `python` if you are using Linux).
2. To make sure the imports are done correctly, put all the dependencies that were just installed into the project's directory.
3. Go to the link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h922YyBB1OZgOX-FqpkKspHkOAiaMs-q?usp=sharing and include these dependencies in your project's directory as well. (These are a set of modules not readily available and cannot be uploaded on GitHub due to upload size constraints.)
4. Run `python Opus.py`.
5. Happy hacking!
